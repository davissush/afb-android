			<h1>How to use this app</h1>
			<ol>
				<li>AFB shares a number of symptoms with other diseases and has one definitive symptom, (pupal tongue). In this application symptoms are given numerical values which are added towards a final score. The higher the score, the greater the chance that a hive is infected with AFB.</li>
				<li>This application is designed so that you can compare the symptoms illustrated, with the symptoms present in your hive.</li>
				<li>If you decide that your hive is displaying a symptom, then that symptoms "score" is accumulated. You will not see the scores. They are added in the background.</li>
				<li>Instructions on how to look for and interpret each symptom, are displayed in the associated “instructions” screen.</li>
				<li>Some symptoms or circumstances are "non visual", but are still important and need to be considered. These are listed after the visual symptoms.</li>
				<li>Your final result will be displayed towards the end of the application.</li>
				<li>What you do next is covered under the "What to do next" page.</li>
